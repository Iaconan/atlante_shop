This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

For this ecommerce project for Bcame test, I used Sanity.

Sanity is an open-source headless CMS written in JavaScript and designed with developers in mind. Voted highest developer satisfaction in the Jamstack Community Survey 2021.

Present content from a unified platform in endless presentations with easy to use APIs and a hosted, headache-free back end.

Get started via the CLI or one of our batteries-included starters.

I will explain in the next interview how setup the Sanity system.
